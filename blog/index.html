    <div class="container px-5">
        <p>Creating a website is an essential step to create your online presence. To create a website, you need a domain name and hosting service.</p>
        <p>It may cost around 10$/year to register a top level domain like .com or even higher but if you are in Nepal, Mercantile Communications provides free domain registration service based on applicant’s name.</p>
        <h2>Requirements:</h2>
        <p>Make sure you have these things ready before applying for a free domain name.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scanned copy of your citizenship</li>
            <li>Scanned copy of a cover letter (A sample has been attached at the end of this article)</li>
            <li>Working internet connection</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Registering a Free .Np Domain Name</h2>
        <p>First head over to <a href="https://register.com.np">https://register.com.np</a> and enter a desired domain name to check its availability. Make sure that your entered domain name must match your name on citizenship. You can not register a random domain name. It is recommended to enter your full name and check for domain name availability.</p>

        <p>Once you see the following interface, click on Register.</p>

        <p>Now log in with your credentials and you’ll reach an interface as below.</p>
        <img src="domain request form.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <p>On this page enter all your details and click on the Save and Continue option.</p>
        <p>On the Nameservers section put the following details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ns1.byet.org</li>
            <li>Ns2.byet.org</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nameservers are actually required to connect your domain name with your hosting service. You can change nameservers anytime and it takes around 24 hours to get updated. You may want to pay for a hosting service or use a free hosting or host your static site on Github pages or Netlify as well.</p>
        <p>On the next step, you’ll have to Submit Required documents to support your domain registration application. First choose your scanned copy of your citizenship certificate and click on save image.</p>
        <p>After that take a screenshot of your cover letter on any text editor like Notepad, choose the copy and click on Save Image.</p>
        <img src="request domain.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <p>After uploading both the files click on Request Domain option.</p> 
        <p>Then you’ll have to wait for a day or two until your domain name is approved.</p>
        <p>If your domain name request is rejected, try with a new variation of your name with a clear copy of your documents.</p>
